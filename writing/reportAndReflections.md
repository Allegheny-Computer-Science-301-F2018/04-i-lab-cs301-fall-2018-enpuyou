## Question 7.
## Use data exploration to determine if other diseases (besides Measles) have enough data to explore the effects of vaccines. Be critical of your online research. Are you convinced by the primary or credible articles that you have found? Be sure to cite all articles.

I looked on WHO(World Health Organization) website for some vaccine data. And I
found data on vaccines for [diphtheria](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.WHS3_41?lang=en)
and [neonatal tetanus](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.1520_56?lang=en).
You can see from the table, that there were dramatic decreasing in the number of
cases reported from 20 years or, more obviously, 40 years before. I am convinced by
these data since they are provided by WHO, which is a specialized agency of the
United Nations. And these data were updated recently this passing summer.

## Question 8.
## In the New York Times article, entitled, [“Journal Retracts 1998 Paper Linking Autism to Vaccines”](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/ 03lancet.html) by Gardiner Harris a research article written by Dr. Andrew Wakefield has been retracted by the authors because it suggests that autism followed from the use of vaccines. Read the article to answer the following reflection questions to place in your writing/reportAndReflections.md file.
### • What is the damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article which states (incorrectly) that autism is a result of vaccines?
### • What should the role of academic research groups and organizations be to ensure that published information is absolutely correct (i.e., has been properly analyzed) before public exposure?
### • The researcher retracted his paper, which means that he no longer supports its content. Is retracting a paper enough to fix the damage to public medicine? How could the damage be fixed if this you do not think that this is enough?
